## An investigation of MP's Expenses

The Independent Parlimentary Standards Authority [provides data](http://www.parliamentary-standards.org.uk/DataDownloads.aspx) for all expense claims made by MP's.  

I thought it would be fun to practice my skills on it.

My goals specifically were to utilise

_Markdown_

* Creating a markdown document
* Utilise parameters to create document templates to be reused (Apply this md to multiple years of MP's expenses)

_Dplyr_

* Practice using the verbs of Dplyr for data manipulation

_ggplot2_

* Practice using ggplot2 to create interesting and clear visuals
